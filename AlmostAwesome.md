## The almost awesome list
This is a list of software packages that did not (yet) made it to the awesome list of open source statistical software for whatever reason.
Reasons could be:
 - interesting but still at early stage of development
 - will probably be moved to another place
 - will be followed up by another package later
 - 
We keep this list for a reference.
It is freely accessible to everyone has no status at all.
